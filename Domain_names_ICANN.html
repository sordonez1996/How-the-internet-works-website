            <h1>Domain names and ICANN</h1>
            <h4>Domain Names</h4>
            <p>Definition: A domain name is a unique name that identifies a website. Each website has a domain name that
                serves as an address, which is used to access the website. Whenever you visit a website, the domain name
                appears in the address bar of the web browser. Some domain names are preceded by "www" (which is not
                part of the domain name). All domain names have a domain suffix, such as .com, .net, or .org. The domain
                suffix helps identify the type of website the domain name represents. </p>
            <p>For example, ".com" domain names are typically used by commercial website, while ".org" websites are
                often used by non-profit organizations. Some domain names end with a country code, such as ".dk"
                (Denmark) or ".se" (Sweden), which helps identify the location and audience of the website.</p>
            <p>Why we use them? On the Internet, your domain name is your unique identity. Any individual, business or
                organization planning to have an Internet presence should invest in a domain name. Having your own
                domain name, website and email addresses will give you and your business a more professional look.
                Another reason for a business to register a domain name is to protect copyrights and trademarks, build
                creditability, increase brand awareness, and search engine positioning.</p>
            <h4>ICANN</h4>
            <p>Definition: ICANN, which stands for Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, is a non-profit
                organization that was established in the United States in 1998 to help maintain the security of the
                Internet and allow it to be usable by all. Anytime you register a domain on the Internet, you go through
                a domain name registrar, who pays a small fee to ICANN to register your domain as part of the domain
                registration process.</p>
            <p>Examples: TBA</p>
            <p>Why we use them? ICANN currently gets its authority to manage the DNS via the IANA contract, granted to
                them by the U.S. government, but that would change under the proposed plan. Authority would pass
                directly to ICANN without U.S. government oversight. While concerns are that other countries will have
                more of an influence on the Internet, the plan is designed with the intentions of avoiding increasing
                any government’s power over the Internet. While it is not ICANN’s job to regulate content online, there
                are concerns that this could come about through shared international control of the DNS. However, there
                is a real effort being made to ensure that ICANN cannot regulate content following the transition. There
                are also concerns over how well ICANN will be able to come to decisions on controversial matters. It is
                vital that these processes are set up correctly from the beginning, because domain-level takedowns could
                lead to violations of freedom of speech and freedom of press.</p>
