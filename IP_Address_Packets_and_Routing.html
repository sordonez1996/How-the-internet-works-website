            <h1>IP Addresses Packets and Routing</h1>
            <h4>IP Addresses</h4>
            <b><p>Definition:</b> An IP address, or simply an "IP," is a unique address that identifies a device on the
                Internet or a local network. It allows a system to be recognized by other systems connected via the
                Internet protocol. There are two primary types of IP address formats used today — IPv4 and IPv6. The
                address of a connected device in an IP network (TCP/IP network), which is the worldwide standard both
                in-house and on the Internet. Every desktop and laptop computer, server, scanner, printer, modem,
                router, smartphone, tablet, and smart TV is assigned an IP address, and every packet (Web, email, video,
                etc.) traversing an IP network contains a source IP address and a destination IP address. There are four
                different types of IP addresses: public, private, static, and dynamic. While the public and private are
                indicative of the location of the network—private being used inside a network while the public is used
                outside of a network—static and dynamic indicate permanency. An IP address is written in "dotted
                decimal" notation, which is 4 sets of numbers separated by period each set representing an 8-bit number
                ranging from (0-255). An example of an IPv4 address is 216.3. 128.12 </p>
            <b><p>For example:</b> In the video, <b>(The Internet - Wires, Cables, WIFI Part 2)</b>, the speaker states <i>"Visiting a
                website is really just your computer asking another computer for information. Your computer sends a
                message to the other computer's IP address, and it also sends along its origin address. So the other
            computer knows where to send it through response." 02:29 .</i></p>
             <b><p>Why we use them?</b> The main reason why IP addresses are used is that it handles the logical routable
                connection from both computers to computer AND network to network.</p>
            <h4>Packets</h4>
             <b><p>Definition:</b> A packet is a small amount of data sent over a network, such as a LAN or the Internet.
                Similar to a real-life package, each packet includes a source and destination as well as the content (or
                data) being transferred. When the packets reach their destination, they are reassembled into a single
                file or another contiguous block of data. While the exact structure of a packet varies between
                protocols, a typical packet includes two sections — a header and payload. In the video <b>(The Internet
            – Packets, routing, and Reliability Part 4)</b>, the narrator states <i>"TCP manages the sending and receiving
                of all your data as packets. Think of it like a guaranteed mail service. When you request a song on your
                device, Spotify sends a song, broken up into many packets. When your packets arrive, TCP does a full
                inventory and sends back acknowledgements of each packet received. If all packets are there, TCP science
            for your delivery, and you're done." 04:18 </i></p>
             <b><p>For example:</b> Every Web page that you receive comes as a series of packets, and every e-mail you send
                leaves as a series of packets. Networks that ship data around in small packets are called
                packet-switched networks</p>
             <b><p>Why we use them?</b> Theoretically, it could be possible to send files and data over the Internet without
                chopping them down into small packets of information. One computer could send data to another computer
                in the form of a long unbroken line of bits (small units of information, communicated as pulses of
                electricity that computers can interpret). However, such an approach quickly becomes impractical when
                more than two computers are involved. While the long line of bits passed over the wires between the two
                computers, no third computer could use those same wires to send information — it would have to wait its
                turn. In contrast to this approach, the Internet is a "packet switching" network. Packet switching
                refers to the ability to network equipment to process packets independently from each other. It also
                means that packets can take different network paths to the same destination, so long as they all arrive
                at the destination. (In certain protocols, packets do need to arrive at their final destinations in the
                correct order, even if each packet took a different route to get there.) Because of packet switching,
                packets from multiple computers can travel over the same wires in basically any order. This enables
                multiple connections to take place over the same networking equipment at the same time. As a result,
                billions of devices can exchange data on the Internet at the same time, instead of just a handful.</p>
            <h4>Routing</h4>
            <b><p>Definition:</b> Network routing is the process of selecting a path across one or more networks. The
                principles of routing can apply to any type of network, from telephone networks to public
                transportation. In packet-switching networks, such as the Internet, routing selects the paths for
                Internet Protocol (IP) packets to travel from their origin to their destination. These Internet routing
                decisions are made by specialized pieces of network hardware called routers. In the video, <b>(The Internet
            - Packets, routing, and Reliability Part 4)</b>, the narrator states <i>"Special computers on the internet
                called routers act like traffic managers to keep the packets moving through the networks smoothly. If
                one route is congested, individual packets may travel different routes through the internet, and they
            may arrive at the destination at slightly different times or even out of order." 03:02</i></p>
            <b><p>Examples:</b> A router provides you with internet access by connecting your LAN with the Internet. </p>
            <b><p>Why we use them?</b> A router helps you connect multiple devices to the Internet and connect the devices.
                Also, you can use routers to create local networks of devices. These local networks are useful if you
                want to share files among devices or allow employees to share software tools. If you don’t have routers,
                your business's data won’t get directed to the right place. For example, if you'd like to print a
                document, you need a router to help get that document to a printer—not to another computer or a
                scanner.</p>
