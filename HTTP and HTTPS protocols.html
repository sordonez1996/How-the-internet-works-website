            <h1>HTTP Protocol</h1>
            <b><p>Definition:</b> HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the protocol used to transfer data over the web.
            It is
            part of the Internet protocol suite and defines commands and services used for transmitting webpage
            data. HTTP uses a server-client model. A client, for example, may be a home computer, laptop, or mobile
            device. The HTTP server is typically a web host running web server software, such as Apache or IIS. When
            you access a website, your browser sends a request to the corresponding web server and it responds with
            an HTTP status code. If the URL is valid and the connection is granted, the server will send your
            browser the webpage and related files. In <b>(The Internet – HTTPP and HTML Part 5)</b>, the narrtor states
            <i>"The browser sends separate HTTP requests for each of these and displays them as they arrive. If a
                webpage has a lot of different images, each of them causes a separate HTTP request and the page loads
                slower. Now, sometimes when you browse the web, you're not just requesting pages with get requests.
                Sometimes you send information like when you fill out a form or type of search query, your browser sends
                this information in plain text to the web server using an HTTP post requests." 02:58 </i></p>
            <b><p>For example:</b> HTTP is the most common protocol you see on the Internet. It provides the gateway for
            community between your computer or device, the client, and the website or online resource found on a
            server. Typically, when you click on a result in a search engine or type a URL into your browser, you're
            making an HTTP request. Most websites that don't need to protect information use HTTP, including news
            websites, blogs, business sites and even advertisement pop-ups.</p>
            <b><p>Why we use them?</b> HTTP is a TCP/IP based communication protocol is used to deliver data (HTML
            files, image
            files, query results, etc.) on the World Wide Web.</p>
            <h1>HTTPS Protocol</h1>
            <b><p>Definition:</b> Hypertext transfer protocol secure (HTTPS) is the secure version of HTTP, which is the
            primary protocol used to send data between a web browser and a website. HTTPS is encrypted in order to
            increase security of data transfer. This is particularly important when users transmit sensitive data,
            such as by logging into a bank account, email service, or health insurance provider. In <b>(The Internet –
            HTTPP and HTML Part 5)</b>, the narrtor states <i>"When you see the little luck that appears in your browser
            address bar next to the HTTPS, the HTTPS protocols ensure that your HTPP requests are secure and
            protected". 05:18</i></p>
            <b><p>For example:</b> HTTP Secure is an extension of HTTP with an extra protocol that encrypts and protects
            your
            information. This protocol requires that you authenticate yourself with the website, which helps to
            protect any sensitive information shared between you and the Web server. Websites that use HTTPS include
            banks, email clients and e-commerce sites. When you log in to these sites, you often see "https" in the
            protocol portion of the URL.</p>
            <b><p>Why we use them?</b> HTTPS protects the communication between your browser and server from being
            intercepted
            and tampered with by attackers. This provides confidentiality, integrity and authentication to the vast
            majority of today's WWW traffic. Any website that shows a lock icon in the address bar is using
            HTTPS.</p>
